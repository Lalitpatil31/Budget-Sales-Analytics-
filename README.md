# Introduction
Welcome to the Budget Sales Analytics project! This repository is dedicated to analyzing budget and sales data to uncover meaningful insights and trends. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques and visualization tools, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how budget allocation impacts sales performance.

# Problem Statement:

* Our "Domain Sale" process is structured to help potential buyers purchase the domain they
want immediately without the hassle of contacting the seller directly. ... A seller lists a domain
for sale at a specific price in our Marketplace. An interested buyer sees this domain for sale and
decides to buy it.

* Extract various information such as Sales, budget, and variance. You can even compare sales
and budgets with various attributes. Extract necessary information about Products and
Customers. Make the necessary dashboard with the best you can extract from the data.

* Use various visualization and features and make the best dashboard. Find key metrics and
factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes. Do your own research and
come up with your findings.
